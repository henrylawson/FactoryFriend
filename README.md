# Introduction
Factory friend is a simple DSL for defining and creating factories in 
.Net. Factory Friend makes creating factories for a large number of
objects easy and maintainable.

# Why use FactoryFriend?
FactoryFriend's true power is seen when utilised alongside a unit level
testing framework. FactoryFriend can be used to clean up and simplify
the repetetive creation of domain model entities. Often the same domain
models are required just in varying states. These states may be "valid",
"invalid", "complete" or "incomplete". FactoryFriend allows you to
define these states in a single location and then provides support for the
extension of these definitions, improving maintainability and reducing
code complexity.

# Getting Started
